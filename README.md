🛒 Electronic Store – JavaScript CRUD Application

Electronic Store is a frontend-only CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application where users can manage electronic product information. Users can add products with a product name, seller name, and price, while the product ID is automatically generated and incremented.

This project is built using modern frontend technologies and uses IndexedDB via Dexie.js for client-side data storage. The application is deployed on Vercel.
